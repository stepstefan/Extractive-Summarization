# Extractive summarization using Recursive Neural Networks

## Petnica 2018 summer research project.  
Research was based on:  
https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Ranking-with-Recursive-Neural-Networks-and-Its-to-Cao-Wei/e522e23a4f4c797478d90afaa5c4d96b30d50aa7

Tensorflow requirement (1.12).
Due to nature of tensorflow and static graphs allocation, execution time fo this implementation is extremely long  
(For every image new graph need to be initialized and there is no option in version 1.x for eager execution)

## TODO: Switch to tensorflow 2.x or PyTorch  
Private repo for now
